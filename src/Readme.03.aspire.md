This continues on initial solution (01.local) that should, when finalized, run via VS2022 on Docker Desktop.

Use this tutorial: [Add .NET Aspire to an existing .NET app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/add-aspire-existing-app?tabs=windows&pivots=visual-studio).


Add a .NET Aspire App Host project, named "DemoOnAspire.AppHost"

Add a .NET Aspire Service defaults project, named "DemoOnAspire.ServiceDefaults"

Make the example app run with .NET Aspire.

The final and completed solution can be found in the `.\03.aspire\final` folder.
